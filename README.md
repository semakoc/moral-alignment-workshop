# Free-Form Data Pipeline for Human-AI Conversations in Surveys (Replit Version)

> **Note:** This version is specifically adapted to run on **Replit**, removing all AWS, Cloudflare tunnel, and database dependencies in favor of a simple, reproducible setup.

This repository contains a lightweight, fully self‑contained web chatbot pipeline designed to support natrualistic human-AI conversation research. It uses OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini` model for conversation and logs all interactions locally to a CSV file for later analysis.

## 🎯 What This Project Is For

This GitHub repository was created to accompany the professional development session *Building Free-Form Data Pipelines for Human-AI Conversations in Surveys*, delivered at the SPSP 2026 Annual Convention in Chicago, IL. The project supports the workshop by providing a concrete, runnable example of how free-form human–AI conversations can be embedded in surveys and logged through a flexible data pipeline. It also serves as a take-home guide for implementing similar projects in the future.

**You do not need prior programming experience to follow the workshop or run the demo version of this project.**

This Replit-based version is designed for education, demonstration, and rapid prototyping. **While Replit offers an accessible environment for workshops and teaching, it is not recommended for formal research data collection involving sensitive participant information.** For production research deployments, we advise using AWS or other secure cloud servers that provide stronger data security, access controls, and compliance support.
